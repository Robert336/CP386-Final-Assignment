The final assignment of the CP386 (Operating Systems) course

## Motivation
the honest answer: needs to be completed for marks :)

## Installation
### LINUX
1. clone the repository

2. 
- Option 1 - Compile and run the program manually
Compile the .c file manually with the following line in the command line by navigating to the path which the files are located.
Run the follow command `gcc -o [ANY NAME] [.c FILE NAME] -lpthread -lrt`
Then, `./[ANY NAME] X X X X`
*note* - [ANY NAME] should be the same from both steps, and Xs get replaced with intagers

- Option 2 - use the Make file
